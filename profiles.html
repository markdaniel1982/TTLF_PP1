                <p class="bio-text">
                    He discovered 'Hard House' not by mistake but by an opportunity presenting itself to him and the
                    universe
                    gracing him with the sound that ultimately would never leave his side. From the age of 16, Jonni,
                    had
                    purchased his first pair of turntables.
                    He had discovered pioneers within the industry that set him off on a path of self-discovery.
                    At the age of 17 he experienced great loss through suicide and cancer, and with this loss he leaned
                    on
                    'Hard House' to move forward with his life,
                    and it then began to create opportunities within his adolescent life, that would change his life
                    forever.
                    With events such as Sundissential, Polysexual, Godskitchen, Insomniacz and Progress from 2000, this
                    propelled him forward to wanting to influence
                    future generations through having these experiences. This led him onto attaining regular residency
                    spots
                    at events across the UK and Europe.
                    The Passion and drive instilled through this musical influence in his life has led him to starting
                    his
                    own brand, and further his production skills.
                    The vision is simple, to share my passion and love for electronic dance music to bring people
                    together,
                    and to create a unique sound and long-lasting memories.

                <p class="bio-text">
                    Hailing from Coventry, DJ Josh B is our newest member of the TTLF Family.

                    Josh B purchased his first set of decks back in the year 2000 aged just 17! After 1 year of being a
                    bedroom DJ, he secured his first weekly residency at Coventry's first hard house after club, the
                    legendary 'FIDGET'.

                    From there Josh soon began his own monthly night called 'Satisfaction' which ran up until 2003. Josh
                    then decided it was time to take his DJ skills to the wider international audience and secured a
                    residency in 'STAR BEACH', Malia Greece, before moving to Leeds in the same year.

                    Josh currently lives back in Coventry and up until recently has been on pirate radio stations all
                    across
                    the Midlands but is hungry to bring back the days when he played at huge 'hard house' party's such
                    as
                    Sundissential North, B2t, Fidget and Crazy Daisy's to name but a few!

                    Josh B prides himself on his friendly but high energy performances on the decks whilst always
                    playing 1
                    or 2 rare tunes that you may not of heard before!

                    We are proud to have him as our newest resident DJ, at TTLF!

                    Chris James
                </h2>
                <p class="bio-text">
                    Chris fell upon the harder sound in around the year 2001 when commercial trance style tunes just
                    didn't
                    cut it!

                    Sundissential then became the norm...and it defined him! In 2002 he began dj'ing and whilst serving
                    away
                    mastered his craft. In 2004 he started to poke into the Birmingham based circuit and featured in
                    afters
                    parties such as Shaft & Shine.

                    The most notable and probably greatest achievement was playing alongside artists such as 12 inch
                    thumpers, Ian M, Rafferty & Kershaw for Sundissential vs Afters!

                    The years that followed were littered with private and personal gigs in Germany mainly, but the love
                    for
                    the sound never faltered!

                    Now with a wisdom of understanding and a desire to keep the flame burning for our sound, Chris hopes
                    to
                    re-ignite the musical memory paths that you have embedded in your brain, to bring smiles and good
                    times
                    back to life.

                Fil-EP
            </h2>
            <p id="fil" class="bio-text">
                Born in the 80s raised in the 90s by modest folk from Birmingham, FiL-EP began his love affair with
                dance
                music when his family pulled together enough sheckles to buy the poor young boy a copy of the Prodigy's
                Experience album. After listening to this constantly day and night, at full blast and to the annoyance
                of
                everyone, there was no surprise he developed a taste for Hard House and Hard Dance in general.

                In the early noughties raving hard on the Sundissential dance floor, giving big sweaty hugs to everyone
                üòâ
                he realised the one thing missing in his life was a set of decks. After spending many years perfecting
                some
                skill he managed to blag a gig on the pirate (at the time) radio station Mix FM with Birmingham based
                legends like DJ Wisk and Tony Moretti. FiL-EP had moved on from Hard House and Hard Dance by this time
                preferring Garage House, Deep House and Drum and Bass.

                After a year of spinning tracks on Mix FM the young DJ decided to dabble in promoting putting events
                (not
                always music related) on at various venues including Subway City Birmingham this was too much work and
                he
                couldn't be arsed with it so he lost interest and decided to try a new hobby; eating‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. and
                producing
                music. üßê

                University followed after failing horribly at the technical wizardry that was not foreseen, blagging
                himself
                2 (yeh I can't believe it either) degrees in music production. This was to be his foundation on which to
                start a new career as a teacher. However, as life does circumstances changed and the balding 30
                something
                needed to go back to doing some proper work and pack in this silly dream he had, had.

                These days the old, fat, bald DJ has managed to blag a new gig with the wonderful people at Trip The
                Light
                Fantastic reigniting his Hard House loins and reminding him of slimmer, hairier times when you could be
                lost
                in the banging music with wonderful people on the dance floor thinking to yourself ‚Äúman I'm in a mess
                where
                is everyone?‚Äù.
